   abstract = {In this paper, we design a pipelined flash ADC to achieve high speed of 2 GHz in 0.18 µm CMOS technology using Cadence design tools. We design a high speed track and hold and a novel thermometer to binary encoder. We considered several approaches to design the track and hold circuit, such as buffered track and hold, switched capacitor track and hold, and single tail track and hold. These circuits are slower or have stability problems. We have used a current mode dual array track and hold, which is not only stable but also ensures good performance at 2 GHz. The thermometer to binary encoder can be designed using fat tree encoder, differential cascade voltage switch using pass gate encoder and ROM encoder with pass gates. We implement a novel encoder, which has advantages of high speed and hardware reduction over existing encoder circuits. A clocked DCVSPG XOR gate and a quantum voltage comparator are also used to improve the speed of the proposed flash ADC.},

   abstract = {<p>Although analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are critical components in mixed-signal integrated circuits (IC), their performance has not been improved significantly over the last decade. To achieve a radical improvement (compact, low power and reliable ADCs), spintronics can be considered as a proper candidate due to its compatibility with CMOS and wide applications in storage, neuromorphic computing, and so on. In this paper, a proof-of-concept of a 3-bit spin-CMOS Flash ADC using in-plane-anisotropy magnetic tunnel junctions (i-MTJs) with spin–orbit torque (SOT) switching mechanism is designed, fabricated and characterized. In this ADC, each MTJ plays the role of a comparator whose threshold is set by the engineering of the heavy metal (HM) width. Such an approach can reduce the ADC footprint. Monte-Carlo simulations based on the experimental measurements show the process variations/mismatch limits the accuracy of the proposed ADC to 2 bits. Moreover, the maximum differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL) are 0.739 LSB (least significant bit) and 0.7319 LSB, respectively.</p>},

As a solution, statistical selection of comparators based on the order of offset voltages has been proposed. This method achieves at-speed on-chip calibration without the need for analog measurements. To increase the linearity and SNDR under the same power consumption, this paper proposes to use multiple comparator groups with different sizing to tune a distribution of offset voltage. We design and fabricate two ADCs, one with only single comparator group and the other with three comparator groups, in a 65 nm bulk general-purpose process. We confirm the ADC operations at a 1 GS/s and validate order statistic based comparator selection. We then confirm INL improvement by using multiple groups under the same number of total comparators.},

   abstract = {A dynamic latched comparator can suffer from three non-idealities: offset voltage, random noise and kickback noise. Specifically in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) the kickback noise of a comparator can noticeably affect the settling time and accuracy of the decision. This work offers an analytical treatment of kickback noise generation, and proposes a synchronized kickback noise cancellation technique, which is achieved via placing clocked NMOS-PMOS capacitors at the proper nodes to cancel out effectively those unwanted charges (electrons or holes) under different operating regions of the MOS devices. The technique is clock-rate insensitive and particularly suitable for the SAR-type ADC as it will not alter the charge stored in the capacitor array. Optimized in 65-nm CMOS the kickback noise is <±0.3 mV in 30× Monte-Carlo simulations at both 50- and 500-MHz clock rates. For 10-bit resolution in a full scale of 1 Vpp, the kickback noise of the proposed comparator comparing with the conventional one is improved by 48×, from 6.27 to 0.13 LSB. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

A reference-embedding flash ADC for a fine stage having only a single capacitive digital-to-analog converter improves the power efficiency and area efficiency as well as the input bandwidth. The proposed sample-and-hold sharing structure not only improves the input bandwidth by removing the effect of the input capacitance of the fine ADC (FADC) but also eliminates the gain error between the coarse ADC and the FADC. The advanced sequential slope-matching offset calibration technique in the eight-time interpolated FADC improves the gain of the voltage-to-time converter and the interpolation linearity. A prototype ADC implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process occupies 0.03 mm&#x00B2;, including offset calibration circuitry.

The measurement results show the maximum INL and DNL of the proposed ADC are +0.48LSB/-0.36LSB and +0.67LSB/-0.25LSB, respectively, and the SFDR performance is over 39dB at 600Msps. Limited by the test environment, the ADC was test below 800MHz instead of 1GHz. Powered with a single 1.8V power supply, the power consumption of the ADC core is about 98mW and the FoM is only 0.76pJ/step*Hz. The proposed ADC has a small core area of less than 0.5mm 2 .},

   abstract = {This paper present a design of a 4-bit low power Flash ADC using Threshold inverting Quantization (TIQ) comparators. Unlike conventional ADC proposed work does not required resistor ladder leads to area and power saving. TIQ comparator compared input signal with internally generated switching voltage and produce thermometer code. An efficient thermometer to binary converter has been design using transmission gate based 2:1 multiplexer. The design is operated at 800mV of input frequency 1KHz, with reduced power consumption of 14.08uW and 200us delay.},

   abstract = {We present a flash ADC design technique that compensates for static nonlinearity of the up-front track-and-hold circuit, so that high speed and high linearity can be obtained at the same time. The proposed technique functions in synergy with a new background comparator offset correction scheme. The excess quantization noise generated due to the background autozero process is derived. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques with measurement results for a 160 MSPS 6-bit flash converter designed in a 0.35-μm CMOS process. The ADC consumes 50 mW from a 3.3 V power supply and has an 5.3 effective number of bits (ENOB) at Nyquist. © 2006 IEEE.},

   abstract = {<p>This paper presents a low-area 8-bit flash ADC that consumes low power. The flash ADC includes four main blocks—an analog multiplexer (MUX), a comparator, an encoder, and an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) block. The MUX allows the selection between eight analog inputs. The comparator block contains a TIQ (Threshold Inverter Quantization) comparator, a control circuit, and a proposed architecture of a Double-Tail (DT) comparator. The advantage of using the DT comparator is to reduce the number of comparators by half, which helps reduce the design area. The SPI block can provide a simple way for the ADC to interface with microcontrollers. This mixed-signal circuitry is designed and simulated using 180 nm CMOS technology. The 8-bit flash ADC only employs 128 comparators. The applied input clock is 80 MHz, with the input voltage ranging from 0.6 V to 1.8 V. The comparator block outputs 127 bits of thermometer code and sends them to the encoder, which exports the seven least significant bits (LSB) of the binary code. The most significant bit (MSB) is decided by only one DT comparator. The design consumes 2.81 mW of power on average. The total area of the layout is 0.088 mm2. The figure of merit (FOM) is about 877 fJ/step. The research ends up with a fabricated chip with the design inserted into it.</p>},

This method aims to reduce both common-mode and differential-mode components of kickback noise in the dynamic latch comparator. This method reduces maximum kickback noise current by more than %68. Also, we use a body voltage trimming calibration scheme to reduce offset from 13.2 mV to ~ 0.3 mV efficiently. This dynamic comparator is simulated in 0.18 µm CMOS technology, which consumes 2.86 µW in each comparison cycle. So it is appropriate for low-power applications.},
